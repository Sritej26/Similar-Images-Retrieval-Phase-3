This file is the README for Group 9's submission of Phase 3 of the CSE 515 project.
This project contains files which, in general, accomplish the following tasks:
 - Perform image classification using SVM, DT, and PPR
 - Create LSH and VA-File index files on data and perform queries.
 - Use SVM and DT to perform query relevance feedback.
 - Create a user interface for all of tasks 4-7.

For information on how to run the files included in this project, as well as the design
decisions made, please reference the report PDF file in the 'Report/' folder. It is redundant
to list all the instructions here in the README as well.

All code is included in the 'Code/' directory. Instructions on how to run the files are
in the Report. In general, however, each file has a number of flags to specify how to run
each file. The files must be run with a version of Python 3.8+ on a Linux operating system;
otherwise the image labels will not match output correctly.

Please ensure that the 'lib/' directory is included in the 'Code/' directory;
this contains a number of custom library functions necessary for the project.

NOTE: In order to run the files in this project, it is necessary to first import the image
database. Please ensure that all images follow the correct naming convention and that
the images are stored in a folder containing ONLY the images. The tasks are not guaranteed
to work if this is not true.

Although it was not required to run the project on sample data before submission,
a sample of some possible human-readable outputs is included in the Outputs folder
for reference. The binary files generated by Tasks 1-5 are NOT included due to their
size.

There are a few types of files in the 'Outputs/' folder:
 - Text files are the outputs obtained from Tasks 1-3. This was the result of running
     the classification on some sample data with k=50 and ELBP as the feature vector.
 - Image files are the results of Tasks 4-8 on queries (or the revised queries).
